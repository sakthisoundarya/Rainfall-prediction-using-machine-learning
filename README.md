# Rainfall-Prediction-using-machine-learning
This project is about predicting rainfall based on some parameters like Temperature, Sea Level Pressure (SLP), Dew Point. Humidity, Visibility, Wind.
We got 27% as the accuracy based on the dataset, as we see the corelation between the attributes is low.

# Demo / Implementation

- ▶️ [Demo | Raindfall Prediction](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Santoshraju1118/Rainfall-Prediction-using-machine-learning/blob/master/Rainfall%20Prediction.ipynb) - predict `Rafinfall` by giving `Parameters`.
